Description:    vanessa_adt is a library that provides a generic logging 
		layer that may be used to log to one or more of syslog, an
		open file handle or a file name. Though due to to
		limitations in the implementation of syslog opening
		multiple syslog loggers doesn't makes sense. Includes the
		ability to limit which messages will be logged based on
		priorities.
Keywords:       Logging Syslog Filehandle File Priority
